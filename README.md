# task2 DeVOps Assembly Lines Training

In this task We have to  do the following

1: Create a container image which have jenkins running and when the image launched jenkins service start automatically.

2: Then we have to create 5 Jobs in jenkins 

A: Job 1 for downloading the repository from github whenever developer pushes new repository.

B: Job 2 for launching the respective language interpreter after seeing the type of file it receives from the github.

C: Job 3 for testing the web application is working or not.

D: Job 4 will monitor job 3 and send the email to the developer if the build fails or we application not working.

E: Job 5 will monitor the container and whenever container fails it will launch the new one within the second.

In this Task I explored a lot about scripting and many other plugin usage such as email notification plugin. 

I also got to know that we can use kubernetes for the Job 5 which will help us monitor smartly and without failing as it is better and faster tool.

Thank You Vimal Daga Sir for making our journey of DevOps filled with knowledge and exploration of  the new concepts and making us work on real world usecases.
